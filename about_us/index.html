  <p>
    Chris and Anne met in High School, where (after a very helpful suggestion from a mutual friend of the couple) Chris asked Anne to Senior Prom.
    They had a great time, continued to date afterward, and had an incredible summer together.
    Unfortunately, the summer had to come to an end.
    In 2010, they headed different ways and dated long-distance.
    Chris attended the University of Michigan, and Anne attended Central Michigan University.
    It wasn't always easy, but they always found time to visit one-another and have a great time in Ann Arbor and Mt. Pleasant.

    After undergrad, Chris took a job at Microsoft in Washington State and Anne worked toward a Masters in Basic Medical Science at Wayne State in Michigan.
    After Anne finished her masters in only one year, she moved on to attending Michigan State University's College of Human Medicine.
    Along the way, they took every chance they could to fly to each other, having fun and exploring Seattle, Detroit, Grand Rapids, Flint, and many more places.
    They've seen some good sights, had some great brunches, and made even better friends all around the country.

    On Christmas Eve 2017, 7 years into dating, they "finally" got engaged!
    It's been a long, winding, and incredible journey, but they're finally about to come together for life (not just in marriage, but also location &#10084;).
