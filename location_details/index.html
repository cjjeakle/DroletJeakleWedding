Ste. Anne de Detroit is the second oldest continuously operating Catholic parish in the United States. 
While founded in 1701, the current building was erected in 1886. 
It contains several elements of previous structures, including the 1818 altar and stained glass windows. 
Crutches may be seen near the altar, which are left by those who credit St. Anne for her healing. 
The parish is bilingual and offers services in English and Spanish.

The Colony Club first opened in 1929 as a women’s club. 
It served as a meeting place and home for its members, with ballrooms styled after Versailles. 
The women’s club disbanded by 1933 and the building then served as the United Auto Worker (UAW) headquarters. 
In 1984, it was leased to the Detroit Police Department to house their Police Academy. 
The Colony Club underwent renovations in 2006 and it currently used as a private event venue.
