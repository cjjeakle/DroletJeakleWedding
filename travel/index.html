<h5>Flying</h5>
<p>
  We suggest out-of-town guests fly into DTW (Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport). 
  There are multiple taxi services that can bring you into the city, such as 
  <a href="https://www.metrocars.com/">Metro Cars</a> and 
  <a href="https://www.uber.com/airports/dtw/">Uber</a>. 
  If you instead opt for a rental car, the drive from DTW to Detroit is approximately 25 minutes.
</p>

<h5>Driving</h5>
<p>
  If you are driving to the wedding, several major highways can bring you into the city, including I-75, M-10, and I-96. 
  Please be mindful of any construction and prepare for possible delays.
</p>

<h5>Accommodations</h5>
<p>
  It is important to note is that there is going to be a large, city-wide event the same weekend as our wedding. 
  <b>Hotel rooms will sell fast.</b> 
  If you do intend on coming (and we’re hoping you do!), please reserve your room as soon as possible.
